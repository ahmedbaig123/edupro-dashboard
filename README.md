EduPro Learner Intelligence Dashboard
 Project Overview:

This project presents an interactive analytics dashboard built using Streamlit and Pandas to analyze learner demographics, enrollment behavior, and revenue insights for an online education platform (EduPro).

The objective is to generate descriptive learner intelligence to support data-driven decision-making in course design, engagement strategy, and inclusivity planning.

 Key Objectives:

The dashboard answers the following questions:

Which age groups are most active on the platform?

How does enrollment vary across demographics?

What course categories and skill levels are most popular?

How deeply do learners engage with the platform?

Which segments generate the highest revenue?

This is a descriptive analytics project, focused on insights rather than prediction.

Dataset Structure:

The project integrates four datasets:

Users – demographic information (Age, Gender)

Courses – course metadata (Category, Level, Type, Price)

Teachers – instructor information

Transactions – enrollment and payment data

The datasets were merged into a unified analytical dataset containing over 10,000 enrollment records.
